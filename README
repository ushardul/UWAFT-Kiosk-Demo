This is the demo application for the UWAFT Kiosk.

The demo application for the UWAFT Kiosk will emulate the features available for the final kiosk application but without polished graphics.

The application will basically be a detailed image of the car which can be zoomed and panned. Clicking on certain parts of the car will result in more information being displayed in a popup context with a rotatable image of the part. Flipping by reaching the edge of the screen and panning will result in different layers of the car being shown/hidden.

The features that are expected to be working in the completed application are the following and will be done by pe:

Geo:
-	Pan on the main drawing of the car
-	Flip to remove and show different internal layers of a car such as chassis, electrical components, mechanical systems, etc.

Arsalan:
-	Zoom on individual areas of the main drawing of the car
-	Click on individual parts of a car to show popup with detailed information on the feature

Shardul:
-	Rotate detailed view of feature
-	Putting together individual parts of UI
